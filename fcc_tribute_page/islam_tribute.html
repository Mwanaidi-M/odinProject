                Islam is the second largest religion in the world after Christianity, with about 1.8 billion 
                Muslims worldwide.

                 Islam started in Mecca, in modern-day Saudi Arabia, during the time of the prophet Muhammad’s life. In Islam, 
                 Muhammad is considered the last of a series of prophets (including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Solomon, and 
                 Jesus), and his message simultaneously consummates and completes the “revelations” attributed to earlier 
                 prophets.

            <h4>sources of Islamic doctrinal and social views</h4>
            <ul>
                 <li><strong>The Qurʾān</strong> <br>
                     Divided into 114 suras (chapters) of unequal length, it is the fundamental source of Islamic teaching. 
                     The suras revealed at Mecca during the earliest part of Muhammad’s career are concerned mostly with 
                     ethical and spiritual teachings and the Day of Judgment. The suras revealed at Medina at a later period 
                     in the career of the Prophet are concerned for the most part with social legislation and the 
                     politico-moral principles for constituting and ordering the community.
                 </li>
                 <li><strong>The Sunnah (“Traditions”)</strong> <br>
                     Sunnah (“a well-trodden path”) was used by pre-Islamic Arabs to denote their tribal or common law. In Islam it 
                     came to mean the example of the Prophet i.e., his words and deeds as recorded in compilations known as Hadith 
                     (in Arabic, Ḥadīth: literally, “report”; a collection of sayings attributed to the Prophet). Hadith provide 
                     the written documentation of the Prophet’s words and deeds. Six of these collections, compiled in the 3rd 
                     century AH (9th century CE), came to be regarded as especially authoritative by the largest group in Islam, 
                     the Sunnis. Another large group, the Shiʿah, has its own Hadith contained in four canonical collections.
                 </li>
                 <li><strong>Ijmāʿ</strong> <br>
                     The doctrine of ijmāʿ, or consensus, was introduced in the 2nd century AH (8th century CE) in order to standardize 
                     legal theory and practice and to overcome individual and regional differences of opinion. 
                 </li>
                 <li><strong>Ijtihād</strong> <br>
                     Ijtihād, meaning “to endeavour” or “to exert effort,” was required to find the legal or doctrinal solution to a 
                     new problem. In the early period of Islam, because ijtihād took the form of individual opinion (raʾy), there was 
                     a wealth of conflicting and chaotic opinions. In the 2nd century AH ijtihād was replaced by qiyās (reasoning by 
                     strict analogy), a formal procedure of deduction based on the texts of the Qurʾān and the Hadith.
